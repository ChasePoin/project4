**Ancient Stone Tools Found in Ukraine Date to Over 1 Million Years Ago, and May Be Oldest in
Europe**  Stone tools discovered in Ukraine have been dated to over 1 million years old, making them
the earliest known evidence of early human presence in Europe. Excavated in the 1970s, these chipped
volcanic rock tools were used for cutting and scraping animal hides. The discovery suggests that
early humans were able to adapt to diverse environments, including the seasonally cold regions of
eastern Europe.
