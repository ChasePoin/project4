**Japan's Precision Moon Lander Hits Target but Appears Upside-Down**  Japan's Smart Lander for
Investigating Moon (SLIM) has successfully landed on the Moon, hitting its intended target with only
a 55-meter deviation. However, the probe is currently upside-down due to a landing mishap, resulting
in the solar panels facing the wrong direction. JAXA is hopeful that the probe will recharge when
the Moon enters its daytime phase in the coming days. Despite the mishap, the pinpoint landing
system has been demonstrated as successful, giving scientists access to more of the Moon's surface.
