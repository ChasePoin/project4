**This simple log structure may be the oldest example of early humans building with wood**
Researchers have discovered a simple log structure from the Stone Age that may be the oldest
evidence yet of early humans building with wood. The pair of crossed logs, which were found in a
riverbed in Zambia, are estimated to be nearly half a million years old. The logs show signs that
they were shaped by humans, including a notch carved into the upper log and tool marks on the
surface. The discovery suggests that early humans were more skilled and adaptable than previously
thought, and that they were using wood for construction and other purposes long before the evolution
of Homo sapiens.
