**Jupiters Moon Europa May Have Less Oxygen Than Expected**  New research suggests significantly
less oxygen on Europa's surface than previously estimated, potentially affecting life in the moon's
subsurface ocean. The findings, based on data from Juno's close flyby, provide a narrower range for
oxygen production at 13-39 pounds per second, compared to earlier estimates of up to 2,245 pounds
per second. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the impact on
potential habitability.
