WASHINGTON (AP)  Astronomers have found three previously unknown moons in our solar system  two additional moons circling Neptune and one around Uranus. 
The distant tiny moons were spotted using powerful land-based telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, and announced Friday by the International Astronomical Unions Minor Planet Center. 
The latest tally puts Neptune at 16 known moons and Uranus at 28.
One of Neptunes new moons has the longest known orbital journey yet. It takes around 27 years for the small outer moon to complete one lap around Neptune, the vast icy planet farthest from the sun, said Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington who helped make the discovery. 
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports on the discovery of three new moons in the solar system.
The new moon orbiting Uranus, with an estimated diameter of just 5 miles (8 kilometers), is likely the smallest of the planets moons. 
We suspect that there may be many more smaller moons yet to be discovered, he said.
