Title: Four astronauts from four countries return to Earth after six months in orbit
SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying four astronauts returns from the International Space Station and splashes down in the Gulf of Mexico. 










CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts from four countries caught a lift back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday to end a half-year mission at the International Space Station.
Their capsule streaked across the U.S. in the predawn darkness and splashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Panhandle.
NASAs Jasmin Moghbeli, a Marine helicopter pilot, led the returning crew of Denmarks Andreas Mogensen, Japans Satoshi Furukawa and Russias Konstantin Borisov.
They moved into the space station last August. Their replacements arrived last week in their own SpaceX capsule. 
We left you some peanut butter and tortillas, Moghbeli radioed after departing the orbiting complex on Monday. Replied NASAs Loral OHara: I miss you guys already and thanks for that very generous gift.
OHara has another few weeks at the space station before leaving aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.
Before leaving the space station, Mogensen said via X, formerly known as Twitter, that he couldnt wait to hear birds singing in the trees and also craved crunchy food.
NASA prefers multiple travel options in case of rocket trouble. Boeing should start providing astronaut taxi service with a two-pilot test flight in early May.
